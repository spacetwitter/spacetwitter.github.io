**Ensure you have completed all the steps before you attempt to connect - it will not allow you to log in otherwise!**

### So, you've come this far. Now, it's time to join the server!

## Adding the server to your multiplayer menu

You will need to launch the game first. 

First, click the button on the main menu saying "Multiplayer". 

Second, click the "Add Server" button. A screen will pop up that allows you to input an a) Server name, and b) Server Address. 

In the Server Name field, you can enter anything you want. Call it Spitter MC if you don't have anything you want to name it for personal reference.

In the Server Address field, you need to enter this: `mc.spitter.space`. This is the IP that allows you to connect to the server.

Now, click Done. This will save and it will pop up from now on in the Multiplayer menu. You should be able to identify which server it is fairly easily!

# BEFORE YOU JOIN please take a moment to read through our rules. By joining the server, you agree to the rules. 

## Connecting

Click the server. It should say something like "Space Twitter Modded Minecraft **Summer Server**". 

You can either click on the rocket icon, or click the text and hit Connect at the bottom of your screen. 

Welcome! On behalf of the server management, we hope you have a great summer!
