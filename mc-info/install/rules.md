# **Minecraft Server Rules**

a) No stealing/griefing. Please try not to decimate *all* the villages. Chests are locked automatically. However, this doesn’t mean you can take from chests that aren’t claimed without permission. Obviously, don’t grief builds.

b) No hacking/xray/baritone. Other mods like HWYLA and QOL stuff is absolutely fine though, as long as it does not give you a large advantage over any other player.

c) Killing on sight or unwarranted PVP is not permitted. Where it makes sense for roleplay purposes, it is permitted. Incidents will be dealt with on a case by case basis. **Please make sure to agree with the player(s) in question if you are going to roleplay PVP and have written agreement.**

## **More info**

i) The server will be governed by a United Nations body in which everyone is permitted to partake in debates. Five leaders of the areas in the server will be appointed to the United Nations High Council, who acts as a representative board and votes on matters regarding the server.


**PUNISHMENTS**
Chat: 3h -> 12h -> 1-7d mute
Griefing:  3h -> 12h-1d -> 3-7d ban
Cheating: 1d -> 7d -> perma ban
__**You may appeal any punishment by opening a ticket (coming soon) in the discord or messaging a staff member**__

> **All blocks placed/broken and items transferred are logged and are viewable on request. If you steal, you WILL get caught!**
